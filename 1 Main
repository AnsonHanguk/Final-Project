// Anson Final (Paper SHop)
// Auther: Anson
// Class: CS161 Spring 2025

// Java program that allows user to enter data, save profile , and purchase paper with total calculaion 


/*
 * Based on the functional requirements outlined in our CS161 Final Project paper, the core of this program will be to: 

1. Have a system which can create/save users
2. Save user information
3. Sell paper listed on assignment paper
4. Calculate how much total cost will be and provide user a bill

Program starts and java.io and utill scanner are imported for use in program
program creates a file direcrtory for saved user information
then program establishes the variables for each product needed for the program
initilize the varibles outlined in method specfiication 

Then program asks for name

If name matches saved user information, they skip to the shop part of the program.

If not, they set up acount with all requierd data listed in the group specification 
 	
When all information is enterd, user is saved to usersinfo.txt and person1 is created in person class 

user now clicks enter to open the shop

all three types of papers and thier cost apears

user can type 1-3 to choose the paper they want

they can then type how many sets of paper they would like to buy

finaly the system creates a receipt with final math calculation

//Program start


//import java.io so system can read data stored on computer
import java.io.* ; 

//Import scanner to allow the user to input their own information to be used in the other classes
import java.util.Scanner;

//set up class
public class Main {
	
	//create a save directory for the program
	static final String SavedUsers = "usersinfo.txt";
	
	
	public static void main(String[]args) {
	
//bring scanner in to allow user input
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);  








//Set up/Initialize variables I want to sell in my paper shop

Product p1 = new Product ("Hammermill Paper", 31.99); 
Product p2 = new Product ("True Red Paper", 55.99);
Product p3  = new Product ("Domtar Paper", 59.29);

//set up the varibales needed for user outlined in req def
String name, lastname, address, billinfo, phone;

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//Setting up acount 

//ask for first name
System.out.println ("Enter your first name");
//next line typed into consol will be first name or match with exisiting user
name = input.nextLine().trim();

//for returning user (name matches
if(customerexists(name)) {

//breaks and moves past else loop, to shop section when they click enter
} else {
//user does no match. Create a new profile
	System.out.println("Thank you for joining our paper shop, we will aks you for a little more information");
	
	//If the user data is not matched with saved data in the txt file the user wil break into this long else loop that sets up thier profile and information
	
	//saves users last name

//phone number
	System.out.println ( "Enter Phone Number (random numbers for a joke)");

	//set up an object, person1 and cary the four variables into the customer class to be used later in the program


	//create customer with enterd user data from scanner

//Buying products

// print all shop information (products to buy)

		//gives instructions

			//This checks to see if the choice is 1. If it is one the systemn will know it is refrencing product 1
